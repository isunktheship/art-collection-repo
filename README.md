# Art Collection Repository

### Wat?
This app is designed to ingest/scrape websites for art details, specifically focusing on valuation data.

### Why?
As an avid screenprint collector I found it quite difficult to track what prints I owned (200+), how much I spent (shh), what the collection was worth overall, and how much I made on prints I sold.

Plenty of valuation data exists online through various existing auction houses (eBay, Sothesby's, Craigslist, liveauctioneers.com, invaluable.com) and forums (expressobeans.com) - the first iteration of this app scrapes the art colleting forum "ExpressoBeans" to provide baseline data for all prints in my collection.

Users can elect to manage their collection manually, in the event valuation data isn't found online.

### Surely this was a simple app to make?
Yes, sort of.  The app contains examples of the following:
 - XML/HTML Parsing
 - User Authentication
 - Charting & Graphing
 - Application Logging
 - Web Scraping
 - Cronological Jobs
 - Reporting
 - Strings & Character Manipulation
 - State Tracking
 - Responsive Design & Styling
 - 3rd Party Library Integration
 - Validation/Testing
